# enduring-music-project
This repository contains a data science project on enduring music. 

Using the Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Artists list (2010), Spotify's Web API and Billboard's Hot 100 Artist Chart, this project aims to answer the following question: 
â€œRolling Stone Magazine ranked their 100 greatest musical artists of all time. At the end of 2023, how has their music endured? Are there any features or characteristics that seem to explain enduring engagement?"
